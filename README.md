# Project1Sam-Ruth

Sam's Notes:

November 2nd: 
1. Created Our Team section based upon Ruth's page designs.
2. Used semantic HTML to conciously create elements and avoid to many generic custom divs.
3. Used Flex display to achieve element placement i.e. Profile images on one side and then name, info and button on the opposide side. 
4. Our Team margin-top increased to 30rem. (Fixed the top section overlapping)
5. Added Ruth and my pictures into the image tags for aesthetics.

3rd November: Changes -
1. Add further styling to Our Team
2. Create Portfolio Section and styling

4th November: Changes - 
1. Added Porfolio section using HTML and CSS
2. Added pictures from projects.
3. Created column structure using flex-box.
4. Made improvements to Our Team Section
5. Added Ruth's button styling to Portfolio Section

5th November: Changes - 
1. Added more images for projects and background use.
2. Added project titles.
3. Create CSS styling for the buttons in 'Our Team' section.
4. Adjusted margins of various elements.

7th November:  - 
1.Paste HTML from Ruth into my version. 
2. Try to create Javascript functionality for burger. 
3. Add styling for burger. 

8th November:
Ruth pushed her changes that added responsive design to almost the whole site. She had also added the hamburger, styling and JS functionality. 
1. I realized that the hamburger would disappear after clicking a link on the hamburger nav bar. This was a small fix that changed the JS to add ClassList.
2. I added responsive design using media queries to the our team section. Now when a max-width of 1200 px is reached, the elements stack and behave much like the porfolio section does below. For this I used: flex-direction: column; & align-items: center;. The parent div already assigned them as flex so they adhere to the behaviour. 



Ruth’s Note 


•	The website wireframe was created by using convo.com. Having a blueprint helps us to visualize the overall structure, content placement, and user interface elements of the website.

•	Sam suggested using semantic HTML such us nav, main, section, and footer instead of div for accessibility and readability purposes.

•	In the header section, the navigation was implemented using the display: flex property. This allowed us to effectively divide it into two distinct sections: the logo and the navbar.

•	The main page features a title, social media icons, a button that leads to the contact page, and a description of our agency.

•	The description text and the social media icons are placed within a flexbox and aligned using the justify-content: space-around property.
