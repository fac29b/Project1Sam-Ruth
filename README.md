# Project1Sam-Ruth

Sam's Notes:
2nd November: Created Semantic HTML section for Our Team. I have tried to utilize HTML element tags as much as possible. I used the <section> tag, H1,h2,img and paragraph tags as well as the button tag.
I then used the CSS to position the elements as per Ruth's design. For this I used the BEM naming convention to organise and target the different elements for styling.
3rd November: Ruth created the top Nav and home section of the page.
I saw that the sections were overlapping, so I created a margin top of 30 rem for the Our Team Section.
As Ruth addded her picture to the repo, I could then add both of our images onto the page. When I created the image tag, I tried to keep in mind it being accessible, so I added alt text to appear if the picture can't. This also helps for voice commands.
Changes:

1. Our Team margin-top increased to 30rem. (Fixed the top section overlapping)
2. Added Ruth and my pictures into the image tags for aesthetics.

3rd November: To Do:

1. Add further styling to Our Team
2. Create Portfolio Section and styling
